# TweetBlog - Blog page/ Group Forum 
Technologies Used: Java, JSP, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, Spring MVC, HSQL-DB
- Built a Java Enterprise Web Application that allows users to maintain the group blog. 
- It contains a public “front page” showing the recent blog in reverse chronological order, along with the author of each post and the date it was posted. Users can even create an account providing username and password, so as to allowing that user, to create a new blog, if logged in. Used the “DAOs” and interfaces combining the Servlets, JSPs and Maven dependencies. 
- Used sessions to maintain the state and HSQL-DB to store the users post, and users profile information.
